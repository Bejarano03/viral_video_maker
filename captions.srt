New York City skyline at

dawn, with subtle music playing

in the background. "In the

00:00:08,811 --> 00:00:10,573
loss echoes through the hearts

somethingâ€”be it family, friendships, or

12
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:21,147
innocence. In this episode, the

00:00:21,147 --> 00:00:22,910
weight of these losses shapes

14
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,672
their choices and defines their

00:00:24,672 --> 00:00:26,434
purpose." Quick montage of intense

16
00:00:26,434 --> 00:00:28,197
interactions: a police chase, a

17
00:00:28,197 --> 00:00:29,959
heartwarming family dinner, and moments

18
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:31,721
of silence at the table.

00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:33,484
"Join us as we explore

00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:35,246
these powerful themes through the

eyes of the Reagans." Final
