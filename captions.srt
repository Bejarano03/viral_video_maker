00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,854
INT. PARK - DAY -

2
00:00:01,854 --> 00:00:03,709
A sunny day. A man

3
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:05,564
in a pristine white shirt,

4
00:00:05,564 --> 00:00:07,419
sipping coffee, throws his trash

5
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:09,274
on the ground, chuckling at

6
00:00:09,274 --> 00:00:11,129
a nearby kid struggling to

7
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:12,984
fly a kite. "He thought

8
00:00:12,984 --> 00:00:14,839
he was untouchable..." CUT TO:

9
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:16,694
SLOW-MOTION of a nearby dog

10
00:00:16,694 --> 00:00:18,549
watching the trash fall, eyes

11
00:00:18,549 --> 00:00:20,404
narrowing. "But karma always catches

12
00:00:20,404 --> 00:00:22,258
up..." The dog dashes towards

13
00:00:22,258 --> 00:00:24,113
the trash, knocking over the

14
00:00:24,113 --> 00:00:25,968
man’s coffee moments later. His

15
00:00:25,968 --> 00:00:27,823
face shifts from smirk to

16
00:00:27,823 --> 00:00:29,678
shock. "Instant regret!" CUT TO:

17
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:31,533
The man, now drenched in

18
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:33,388
coffee and surrounded by scattered

19
00:00:33,388 --> 00:00:35,243
trash. The kid laughs, kite

20
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:37,098
soaring high. "Treat others well,

21
00:00:37,098 --> 00:00:38,953
or prepare for the consequences!"

22
00:00:38,953 --> 00:00:40,808
An animated graphic appears: “KARMA

23
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:42,663
is real!” END SCREEN: “Subscribe
