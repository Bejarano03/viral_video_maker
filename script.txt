INT. PARK - DAY - A sunny day. A man in a pristine white shirt, sipping coffee, throws his trash on the ground, chuckling at a nearby kid struggling to fly a kite. "He thought he was untouchable..." CUT TO: SLOW-MOTION of a nearby dog watching the trash fall, eyes narrowing. "But karma always catches up..." The dog dashes towards the trash, knocking over the man’s coffee moments later. His face shifts from smirk to shock. "Instant regret!" CUT TO: The man, now drenched in coffee and surrounded by scattered trash. The kid laughs, kite soaring high. "Treat others well, or prepare for the consequences!" An animated graphic appears: “KARMA is real!” END SCREEN: “Subscribe for more karma tales!”
