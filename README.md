# VVV 

## Description

The rapid, 24/7 nature of social media creates immense pressure on content creators to consistently produce new video content. This process is time-consuming and often leads to creative burnout. We built VVV to solve this problem by automating the initial video creation workflow, allowing influencers to spend less time on ideation and more time engaging their audience.
